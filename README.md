We built a Virtual door lock that let you see the visitors and grand access to them remotely.

## Working 

Here is how it works:

Once an unidentified visitor approach your webcam, a meessage will be sent to your phone

After clicking the url, the face of the visitor will be shown and you can decide whether to grand him access or not.

Once you grand access to the visitor, the vistor can get One Time Passcode(OTP) to access your recources.
